# Project-Epsilon
A game I'm working on. I'm incredibly new to the programming world, so let's hope it works. As far as I know, it will begin as an RPG of sorts, but I don't know what else to do from there. I already have a team working on it, but if there are any suggestions or pointers that will help make it a lot easier, I would really appreciate it!
